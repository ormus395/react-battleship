# Battleship React

### this is a battleship game built using modern React;

This project was created for the Headbutt Keyboards blog found at [jarecturner.tech](jarecturner.tech)

The premise is to create a battleship game to teach people React.
Its goint to start small, simple logic ect, then be built upon.
Like adding the ability to create your own board. Then battle the computer. Eventually this project will grow into something much larger. _At least, thats the hope anyway._

#### Stay Tuned y'all
